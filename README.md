# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL

## 📚 Overview
This project leverages SQL to analyze and visualize pizza sales data. By querying and transforming raw data, the analysis provides actionable insights to drive data-informed decisions for improving business performance.

### Key Aspects of the Analysis:
- **Data Extraction:** Use SQL to retrieve key information such as revenue, order details, pizza prices, and ingredients.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identify peak sales hours, popular pizza types, and seasonal demand patterns using aggregate functions and time-series analysis.
- **Profitability Insights:** Calculate profit margins, identify high-revenue products, and analyze customer spending habits.
- **Performance Metrics:** Rank stores or categories by sales performance and find improvement areas with advanced SQL techniques like window functions.

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries
### Retrieve Total Orders
  sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders;


### Calculate Total Revenue
  sql
SELECT SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM pizza_sales;
  

### Identify Most Common Pizza Size
  sql
SELECT size, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM orders
GROUP BY size

LIMIT 1;
  

### Top 5 Most Ordered Pizzas
  sql
SELECT pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 5;
  

### Revenue Contribution by Pizza Type
  sql
SELECT pizza_type, 
       SUM(price * quantity) / (SELECT SUM(price * quantity) FROM pizza_sales) * 100 AS percentage_contribution
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_type
ORDER BY percentage_contribution DESC;
